// Chapter 2 - Program Structure

// Exercise - Looping a Triangle
/* Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
#
##
###
####
#####
######
####### 
*/
/*
let triangleString;
for (let num = 0; num < 7; num += 1) { 
    if (num === 0) {
        triangleString = "#";
        console.log(triangleString);
    } else {
        triangleString += "#";
        console.log(triangleString);
    }
}
*/
// Exercise 2 - FizzBuzz
/* Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. 
For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), 
print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible
by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those). */
/* 
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    // console.log(i);
    if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
        console.log("FizzBuzz");
    } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
        console.log("Fizz");
    } else if(i % 5 === 0) {
        console.log("Buzz");
    } else {
        console.log(i);
    }
}
 */
// Exercise 3 - Chessboard
/* Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, 
using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid 
there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard. */
/* Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and 
change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height. */

let string1 = "David said, \"hi\"";
console.log(string1);

for (let height = 0; height <= 7; height++) {
    for (let width = 0; width <= 7; width++) {

    }
